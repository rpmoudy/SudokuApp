**DISCLAIMER** Pencil mode does not work because I haven't programed that logic yet. I need to refactor quite a bit of the code to account for this and just haven't set time aside to implement this. 

I have screenshots attached of the working program. Every game is randomly generated and back solved before it starts. A timer appears in the upper right hand side when the user clicks anywhere on the squares. 

Use Android Studio, as IDE, if you wish to open the project.
